\# Introduction

The Jupyter notebook file 'Final\_code.ipynb' performs the denoising and deblurring of the signal y[n] to obtain back the original signal via 2 systems.

The file executes the following sequence:

1. Scatter and line plots of y[n] and x[n]
1. System 1
1) Denoise y[n] to get y1n and plot graph of y1n
1) Deblur y1n to get x1[n]
1. DTFT of h[n] and its plot
1. DTFT of y1n and its plot
1. Deblurring function to get x1[n]
1. Plot of final signal x1[n]

\3. System 2

1) Deblur y[n] to get y2n and its plot     # this is done using the functions defined in system1
1) Denoise y2[n] to get x2[n]
1) Plot of final signal x2[n]

\4. Comparison of signals

1) x1[n] and x[n]
1) x2[n] and x[n]
1) x1[n] and x2[n]
1) x1[n],x2[n],x[n],y[n]

\# To run the code

Upload the file 'Final\_code.ipynb' into Jupyter and run all cells.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

\# Requirements

* Libraries
1. csv
1. matplotlib  # this library is only installed and used for data visualization purpose
1. cmath (inbuilt in python)

(no inbuilt functions and libraries except cmath are used for writing the main codes)

* Jupyter notebook (Anaconda Navigator 3)
* Python 3
